This Privacy Impact Assessment is being published as required by AOPA&#39;s agreement with the FAA to provide its medical education course to help pilots meet the requirements of Section 2307 of FESSA.</p><p><strong>I. OVERVIEW AND INTENDED USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED</strong></p><p>The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to general aviation, headquartered in Frederick, Maryland. With hundreds of thousands of members, AOPA is the largest, most influential general aviation association in the world. AOPA works to secure the future of general aviation through advocating on behalf of our members, educating pilots, non-pilots, and policy makers alike, supporting activities that ensure the long-term health of general aviation, fighting to keep general aviation accessible to all. AOPA worked for years on behalf of its members to bring about third class medical reform, which was enacted by section 2307(c) of the FESSA and implemented by FAA regulations in 14 CFR part 68, which the FAA now refers to as &quot;BasicMed.&quot;</p><p>AOPA is offering a free online medical education course to allow to pilots comply with Section 2307 of FESSA and the FAA&#39;s BasicMed rules, which require pilots to have completed a medical education course during the 24 calendar months before acting as pilot in command under the BasicMed rules and to demonstrate proof of completion of the course.</p><p>To be an approved medical education course for pilots, AOPA&#39;s medical education course must meet the following requirements of Section 2307(c) of FESSA and BasicMed rules:</p><ul><li>Be available on the Internet free of charge;</li><li>Be developed and periodically updated in coordination with representatives of relevant nonprofit and not-for-profit general aviation stakeholder groups;</li><li>Educate pilots on conducting medical self-assessments;</li><li>Advise pilots on identifying warning signs of potential serious medical conditions;</li><li>Identify risk mitigation strategies for medical conditions;</li><li>Increase awareness of the impacts of potentially impairing over-the-counter and prescription drug medications;</li><li>Encourage regular medical examinations and consultations with primary care physicians;</li><li>Inform pilots of the regulations pertaining to the prohibition on operations during medical deficiency and medically disqualifying conditions.</li><li>Provide the checklist developed by the Federal Aviation Administration in accordance with 2307(b).</li><li>Upon successful completion of the course, electronically provide to the individual and transmit to the Federal Aviation Administration&#8212;</li><ul><li>A certification of completion of the medical education course, which shall be retained in the individual's logbook and made available upon request, and shall contain the individual's name, address, and airman certificate number;</li><li>A release authorizing single access to the National Driver Register through a designated State Department of Motor Vehicles to furnish to the FAA information pertaining to the individual's driving record;</li><li>A certification by the individual that the individual is under the care and treatment of a physician if the individual has been diagnosed with any medical condition that may impact the ability of the individual to fly, as required under &#167; 61.23(c)(3) of this chapter;</li><li>A form that includes&#8212;</li><ul><li>The name, address, telephone number, and airman certificate number of the individual;</li><li>The name, address, telephone number, and State medical license number of the physician performing the comprehensive medical examination;</li><li>The date of the comprehensive medical examination; and</li><li>A certification by the individual that the checklist described in &#167; 68.7 was followed and signed by the physician during the medical examination required by this section; and</li></ul><li>A statement, which shall be signed by the individual certifying that the individual understands the existing prohibition on operations during medical deficiency by stating: &quot;I understand that I cannot act as pilot in command, or any other capacity as a required flight crew member, if I know or have reason to know of any medical condition that would make me unable to operate the aircraft in a safe manner.&quot;</li></ul></ul><p>Upon successful completion of the medical education course and the individual&#39;s provision of the required information described above, AOPA will electronically provide to the individual a certificate of course completion and transmit to the FAA the information above, as required by Section 2307(c) of FESSA.</p><p>Successful completion of this AOPA medical education course within the past 24 calendar months satisfies the medical education course requirement in FAR 61.23(c) for an individual seeking to act as Pilot in Command under BasicMed regulations. Pilots operating under &quot;BasicMed&quot; regulations are required to retain the certificate of completion with his or her logbook and make it available upon request.</p><p><strong>II.

AOPA has limited information collection to the minimum necessary to comply with Section 2307(c) of FESSA. The likelihood of erroneous information is limited because the individual user directly provides all of the information collected. No AOPA employee, besides the AOPA Database Administrator and the Director of Infrastructure will have direct access to the information collected. Permission to access information collected must be approved by AOPA&#39;s Privacy and Security Officer. All AOPA information technology personnel are required to attend periodic refresher training on related security and privacy policies as part of continuous improvement initiatives. The periodic monitoring, of logs and accounts, helps to prevent and/or discover unauthorized access attempts. Additionally, the information is stored in a physical location that is protected by escort requirements for access.</p></div></div></div><div id="form_validation_popup" class="overlay"><div class="popup"><a class="close" href="javascript:void(0)" onclick='$("#form_validation_popup").hidePopup()'>&times;</a><div class="content"><p class="validation_popup_error">Oops!

Other information about height, weight, and eye color will ensure correct positive identification.</p><p><strong>Security of Your Personal Information</strong></p><p>Properly securing the information we collect online is a primary commitment. To help us do this, the FAA takes the following steps, once data is submitted to it, to: (a) employ internal access controls to ensure the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties; (b) train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures to know requirements for compliance; (c) secure the areas where we hold hard copies of information we collect online; (d) perform regular backups of the information we collect online to insure against loss; (e) use technical controls to secure the information we collect online, including but not limited to Secure Socket Layer (SSL), encryption, firewalls, and password protections; (f) periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance; (g) employ external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts of outsiders to hack into, or cause harm to, the information in our systems. Tampering with FAA&#39;s website is against the law. Depending on the offense, it is punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. General Aviation stakeholder groups providing a BasicMed online course have entered into agreements with the FAA to take identical steps to protect your information while your data is in their possession.</p><p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong></p><p>The FAA will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect FAA and customer feedback. The FAA encourages you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how the FAA is protecting your information.</p></div></div></div><div id="form_exam_date_validation_details_popup" class="overlay"><div class="popup"><a class="close" href="javascript:void(0)" onclick='$("#form_exam_date_validation_details_popup").hidePopup()'>&times;</a><div class="content"><p class="validation_popup_error">The FAA published the Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (CMEC) on April 24, 2017 and all BasicMed exams must occur on that date or after to be valid.
