Tampering with FAA's website is against the law. Depending on the offense, it is punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. General Aviation stakeholder groups providing a BasicMed online course have entered into agreements with the FAA to take identical steps to protect your information while your data is in their possession.</p><p><strong>Changes to this Statement</strong></p><p>The FAA will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect FAA and customer feedback.
