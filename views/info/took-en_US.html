	<h2>Steps to Take Return to Course to Submit CMEC Information</h2>
	<h3>IMPORTANT!<br>
	You are not current to fly under BasicMed until you follow the steps outlined below. </h3>
<p>You have a 90-day window between having taken the course, seeing your state-licensed physician for the BasicMed-specific exam, and submitting the CMEC information digitally from the within the course&nbsp; <strong>to become current to fly under BasicMed</strong>. After 90 days, your course progress will be cleared and you will be required to retake the course.</p>
		<p><strong>Remember, course renewal is based on 24 calendar months from the last day you completed the course and passed the quiz. This renewal date is <em>independent</em> from when you submit your CMEC information.</strong> For example, if you submit the CMEC information 89 days after you completed the course, you'd have a 21-month course renewal window. This is why it is advised that you complete the CMEC specific exam <strong><em>before</em></strong> taking the course and completing them both in the same month.</p>
<div>
<p>Remember, you <strong>must have a current <em>and</em> valid U.S. driver&rsquo;s license</strong>; it is required to fly under BasicMed. <a href="##-PopUp" onclick="on()">Learn More</a>.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Any current and valid driver's license issued by a State, territory, or possession of the United States can be used to meet the driver's license requirement in BasicMed. If your driver&apos;s license has been suspended, revoked, or denied for health or legal reasons you do not meet the minimum requirements to fly under BasicMed.</li>
  		<li>Any restrictions on the driver's license also apply to exercising pilot privileges under BasicMed. A typical example would be the requirement to use glasses or corrective lenses while driving, so that restriction would apply while flying, too.</li>

</div>
<!--START How to resubmit your CMEC-->
<p><strong>If you need to resubmit your CMEC information for any reason</strong>, you must retake the course and pass the quiz again. If you have already completed the course in the last 90 days, you will have to contact AOPA to have your course reset to allow you to retake it. You will need to complete the course and pass the quiz again to submit your CMEC information to the FAA digitally. There is not an option to mail anything into the FAA or AOPA for this step.</p>

	<h2>Any new health events since your last BasicMed application?</h2>
	<p>Remember that you need to self-certify with each renewal. You can use the <a href="##-I-eligibilityTool">AOPA BasicMed Eligibility Tool</a> to help confirm your eligibility. Remember that ANY new medical events that pertain to certain cardiac, neurological, or mental health conditions will require a new special issuance from the FAA, even if you already have a special issuance for a different condition or event. </p>

<div class="steps">
<!--Start Step 1 CMEC Form-->
	<input type="checkbox" id="step1" name="step1" value="CMEC"><h3>Step 1: Get the BasicMed FAA CMEC Form</h3>
		<p>Review if you&apos;re eligible for BasicMed and download the BasicMed FAA Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (CMEC). Complete the self-assessment portion of the form <strong>before</strong> you visit your state-licensed physician.</p>

<!--END Step 1 CMEC Form-->

<!--START Step 2 Doctor Visit - Already took course-->
	<input type="checkbox" id="step2" name="step2" value="DoctorExam"><h3>Step 2: See Your Doctor</h3>
<p>Take your Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (from Step 1) and get a BasicMed-specific physical exam by a state-licensed doctor. Have your doctor fill out the rest of the exam checklist. You will need this to complete Step 3 and you will need it again for your 24-month renewal.</p>
<!--END Step 2 Doctor Visit - Already took course-->

<!--There is no standard step 3 take course for this page -->

<!--START: Step 3B Submit to FAA-->
<input type="checkbox" id="step3B" name="step3B" value="SendToFAA"><h3>Step 3: Submit Your CMEC Information to the FAA</h3>
<p>After completing the medical exam with your state-licensed physician, log back into the course. You should see your account profile page. It may feature a warning message in <span style="color:red">red</span>.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Click the "File with FAA and Download Certificate" button to access the FAA submission form.</li>
		<li>Fill out the pilot information portion of the form. Ensure it matches the information on your pilot certificate and the FAA Airmen Registry.</li>
		<li>Fill out the state-licensed physician's medical exam information from your most recent CMEC form.</li>
		<li>Review and accept the required assertion statements about your health and the required national driver license register authorization. These are not optional.</li>
		<li>Click the "submit to FAA and download certificate" button. AOPA will securely submit your completed course information to the FAA on your behalf.</li>
		<li>You <strong>do not mail</strong> anything to the FAA or AOPA.</li>
  </ol>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your course renewal date is based on the date you passed the quiz, and NOT the date you submitted your exam information in the post-course form. Make sure you note the dates of both your course and exam dates, especially&nbsp; if they fall in different months.</p>

<!--START Legal Warning -->
  <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Using the online form at the end of the course, you must submit details from your most recent BasicMed Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (CMEC) to the FAA with each course completion. Earning the course completion certificate without a current CMEC from a BasicMed-specific exam <strong>does not meet the legal requirements</strong> to fly under BasicMed.</p>
<p>Be aware, you should not be tempted to enter temporary or placeholder information in the post-course CMEC form to download your certificate while you wait for your actual information. Only enter actual data from your most recent BasicMed exam preformed by a license state physician. Any information that you enter in the post-course form is sent directly to the FAA and is associated with your airmen record.</p>
<p><em>Under the Federal Aviation Regulations, anyone who makes an intentionally false statement on the CMEC may face FAA legal enforcement action, such as revocation of their FAA certificates as well as other serious penalties.</em></p>

<!--START: Step 4 Save Docs -->
<input type="checkbox" id="step4" name="step4" value="SaveDocs"><h3>Step 4: Save Documents in Your Logbook</h3>
<p>Once youâ€™ve completed the course, download your course completion certificate and keep it with your completed CMEC in your logbook or electronically. You need to have it available upon request from FAA.</p>
<!--END: Step 4 Save Docs -->

<!--START: Mark Calendar -->	
	<input type="checkbox" id="step5" name="step5" value="MarkCalendar"><h3>Step 5: Mark your Calendars</h3>
<p>Mark your calendars 24 months from your course completion date, and 48 months from your CMEC completion date, to remind yourself that you will need to renew and/or requalify at those points in time. In 24 months, you will need to retake the course and pass the quiz again. In 48 months, you will need to see your doctor <em><strong>before</strong></em> you retake the course. You can also find these dates in the <a href="https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/" target="_blank" alt="Find your BasicMed completion dates on the FAA's Airman Registry">FAA's Airman Registry</a> if you forget.</p>
<p><span style="color:red"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></span> If you do not have your most recent CMEC and completion certificate, even between renewals, <strong>YOU ARE NOT LEGAL TO FLY</strong> under BasicMed. You need them available upon FAA request.</p>
