      <h1>Welcome to BasicMed</h1>
      <h2>A new way to complete your self-assessment</h2>
      <p>BasicMed has simplified the medical process and opened up the flight deck to many pilots who for whatever reason can no longer hold a traditional medical certificate, or don't want to go through that process.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of pilots can potentially fly under BasicMed. Under the reforms, pilots who have held a valid medical certificate anytime after July 15, 2006 may not need to take another exam with an FAA Aviation Medical Examiner. AOPA has developed this online tool to help you determine if you may qualify for BasicMed.</p>

      <p class="center">You can verify your previous FAA medical dates in the <a href="https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/" target="_blank" alt="Find your BasicMed completion dates on the FAA's Airman Registry">FAA's Airman Registry</a></p>

            <h3>Step 1: Get the BasicMed FAA CMEC Form</h3>
          </label>
        </div>
        <p>Review if you're eligible for BasicMed and download the BasicMed FAA Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (CMEC). Complete the self-assessment portion of the form before you visit your state-licensed physician.</p>
        <p class="center"><a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Form/FAA_Form_8700-2_OMB_EXP_06-2026.pdf" class="button btn btn-register-link" style="padding: 13px 35px !important; margin: 0 !important; font-size: 0.9em;" target="_blank">Download CMEC Form</a></p>
        <p class="center"><a href="##-L-basicmedcoursethendoctorvisit.html">Did you complete your online course before your doctor visit?</a></p>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <div class="step">
          <label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="step2" name="step2" value="DoctorExam">
            <h3>Step 2: See Your Doctor</h3>
          </label>
        </div>
       <p>Take your Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (from Step 1) and get a BasicMed-specific physical exam by a state-licensed doctor. Have your doctor fill out the rest of the exam checklist. You will need this to complete Step 3 and you will need it again for your 24-month renewal.</p>
	<p>NOTE: DO NOT take the online course <em><strong>before</strong></em> you have seen your doctor. That may require you to take it again, after your exam.</p>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <div class="step">

            <h3>Step 3: Take Online Course</h3>
          </label>
        </div>
        <p>Once you have completed your FAA CMEC, including the information from your state-licensed physician, take this online course and pass the quiz. Be aware that to take the course, you’ll have to create a BasicMed specific online account to complete the course. You cannot use any existing accounts you may hold for AOPA.org.</p>
<p>You must complete the post-course form (the form you fill out after you complete the quiz, where you enter your personal and doctor/exam information, from Step 2) to the FAA to earn your BasicMed completion certificate.</p>
<p>Submission of this online form sends your information to the FAA digitally. Nothing to mail. </p>

            <h3>Step 4: Save Documents in Your Logbook</h3>
          </label>
        </div>
        <p>Once you've completed the course, download your course completion certificate and keep it with your completed CMEC in your logbook or electronically. You need to have it available upon request from FAA.</p>

        <!-- Step 5 -->
        <div class="step">
          <label>
            <input type="checkbox" id="step5" name="step5" value="MarkCalendar">
            <h3>Step 5: Mark your Calendars</h3>
          </label>
        </div>
        <p>Mark your calendars 24 months from your course completion date, and 48 months from your CMEC completion date, to remind yourself that you will need to renew and/or requalify at those points in time. In 24 months, you will need to take the course and quiz again. In 48 months, you will need to see your doctor <em><strong>before</strong></em> you retake the course. You can also find these dates in the <a href="https://amsrvs.registry.faa.gov/airmeninquiry/" target="_blank" alt="Find your BasicMed completion dates on the FAA’s Airman Registry">FAA’s Airman Registry</a> if you forget.</p>
<p><span color="red"><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></span> If you do not have your most recent CMEC and completion certificate, even between renewals, YOU ARE NOT LEGAL TO FLY under BasicMed. You need them available upon FAA request.</p>

	<p><span style="color:#0079a4">Make sure you have a current valid driver&apos;s license, valid flight review, and you are ready to <em>fly!</em></span></p>
