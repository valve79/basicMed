<h1>Special Issuance Required</h1>
<p>If you had a recent change in health or a medical event and have not previously had an FAA special issuance authorization for that condition, you <strong>may</strong> need authorization for special issuance of your medical certificate for that specific event or condition before you can qualify to fly under BasicMed.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>You must have a <strong>current <em>and</em> valid U.S. driver&rsquo;s license</strong> to fly under BasicMed. If a health or legal event has caused a suspension, revocation, or cancellation of your license you are not eligible for BasicMed until you possess a current and valid U.S. driver&rsquo;s license. </li>
    <li>If you previously held an authorization for special issuance of your medical certificate for any condition below, the medical certificate must have been <strong>valid after July 14, 2006,</strong> for you to be considered eligible for BasicMed. If it was not valid after this date you must obtain a new one-time FAA special issuance medical certificate.</li>
    <li>If you have had or were diagnosed with any of the conditions described below and have not previously had an FAA special issuance authorization for that condition, you may not fly under BasicMed until you have been granted a one-time authorization for special issuance of your medical certificate by the FAA.</li>
    <li>If you were diagnosed with a cardiovascular condition, review the information about <a href="https://www.aopa.org/go-fly/medical-resources/health-conditions/heart-and-circulatory-system" target="_blank" alt="cardiac special issuance requirements">heart and circulatory system health conditions</a> and which require special issuance requirements <strong>before you begin</strong> the special issuance process.</li>
    <li>Aviation Medical Examiners (AMEs) <strong>are NOT able to grant the initial authorization</strong> for special issuance of a medical certificate. The AME must defer these medical applications to the FAA to determine eligibility for the initial special issuance authorization.</li>
    <li>Pilots requiring an authorization for special issuance of their medical certificate should contact the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association for more information <strong>before contacting the FAA or seeing an AME</strong>.</li>

<!--END Step 1 Special Issuance-->

<!--START Step 2 Authorization for Special Issuance-->
<h3>Step 2: Authorization for Special Issuance of Your Medical Certificate</h3>
<p>The FAA <strong>must</strong> grant the initial authorization for a special issuance of your medical certificate, not your AME.</p>
<p><strong>Before you start</strong> the process of applying for authorization for special issuance of your medical certificate, contact the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association for information about what you need before seeing an AME. <strong>We can help you with an overview of the requirements</strong> and address any concerns you should be aware of before scheduling your exam with an AME.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You may be able to reduce some of the time it takes for special issuance reviews by making sure you <strong>provide <em>all the required</em> information upon the initial application submission</strong> to the FAA. Failing to provide all required information during your initial application can greatly delay your approval. Contact the AOPA Pilot Information Center <strong>before applying;</strong> they can help confirm you are providing the required information and potentially reduce your wait.</p>
<p>Call AOPA&apos;s Pilot Information Center at <a href="tel:8008722672">(800) 872-2672</a>, Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. EST, or email <a href="mailto:medicalassist@aopa.org?subject=Special Issuances Requirements for BasicMed">medicalassist@aopa.org</a>. Please identify yourself as someone looking for assistance with special issuances requirements for BasicMed. </p>
<!--END Step 2 Authorization for Special Issuance-->

<!--START Step 3 Visit AME for Special Issuance-->
<h3>Step 3: Schedule an Appointment with an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME)</h3>
<p><strong>If your last FAA medical certificate has expired, you will need to have a new physical exam with an Aviation Medical Examiner</strong>. Complete the <a href="https://medxpress.faa.gov/medxpress/" target="_blank" alt="FAA MedXpress">MedXPress</a> application and schedule the exam with your AME, who will defer your application to the FAA to determine your eligibility for authorization for special issuance of your medical certificate.</p>

<!--START Next Steps -->
<h2>After Receiving Authorization for Special Issuance</h2>
<p>Once you have received authorization for special issuance of your medical certificate, you will need to follow the same steps as you would for completing the initial BasicMed requirements. This will help assure that you are in good health and ready to fly.</p>
<p>Remember, you <strong>must have a current <em>and</em> valid U.S. driver&rsquo;s license</strong>; it is required to fly under BasicMed.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Some insurance companies require more frequent BasicMed renewals or even a third-class medical to obtain or maintain coverage. Contact your insurer for further details related to your policy when considering flying under BasicMed.</p>
