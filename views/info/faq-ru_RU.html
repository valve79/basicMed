You will not be able to download your BasicMed course completion certificate just yet, you will need your exam information to complete the form. You have 90 days from the day that you completed the course and passed the quiz to return to this site, log back in, and submit your information to fly under BasicMed privileges. Remember, you cannot fly under BasicMed privileges until you <strong>have both</strong> your completed medical exam checklist and your BasicMed course completion with your logbook.</li><li>Do I need to complete BasicMed requirements, if I hold a current medical right now, or should I just fly on it until it expires and then use BasicMed?</li><li>You can continue to fly under your current medical until it expires. Then you can decide if you would like to fly under a traditional AME medical exam or BasicMed. Make sure to review the BasicMed requirements and aircraft and operating restrictions before deciding, see the <a href="https://basicmedicalcourse.aopa.org/pub/bundles/course_61001/downloads/AOPABasicMed_Pilot_and_Physicians_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" class="noWrap">AOPA BasicMed Pilot and Physician Guide</a> (PDF 651 KB) for more details. If you decide to fly under BasicMed, then see your physician for a BasicMed specific examination, have the medical forms completed, and take the course with a passing quiz grade to keep flying under your new BasicMed privileges.</li><li>If I took a recent flight physical for a 3rd class medical, can I use that to satisfy the doctor’s exam requirement?</li><li>No. Section 2307 of FESSA did not allow for an exam associated with an FAA-issued medical certificate to substitute for a comprehensive medical examination. Your physician, must perform a BasicMed specific medical exam and must also complete the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Form/FAA_Form_8700-2_OMB_EXP_06-2026.pdf" target="_blank">FAA Medical Exam Checklist (CMEC)</a>. This completed form must be kept with your course completion in your logbook.</li><li>Why must I not use the FAA’s MedXPress system?</li><li>The FAA’s MedXPress system is only for completing an application for an FAA First, Second, or Third Class medical certificate. If you are pursuing BasicMed qualifications, you must download and print the FAA’s Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist.</li><li>Where do I send my completed CMEC medical form after my doctor visit?</li><li>Right into your logbook (or keep it electronically). Yup, that is it. You do not send the actual form to the FAA. Keep the completed CMEC form in your logbook with your course completion certificate. That is, it. All the information the FAA requires is automatically filed when you complete the post-course form. The CMEC doctor visit information and your pilot certificate information are submitted before you receive your course completion certificate. Keeping both your CMEC and course completion certificate in your logbook, or electronically, will make it easier to complete your 24-month renewal requirement of retaking the course. You will need your previous CMEC visit information to be reentered as part of the course completion between your 4 years to the day doctor exam requirements.</li></ul><h1><strong>Login, Course and Certificate Questions</strong>:</h1><ul class="accordion"><li>What if I want to take the course without receiving BasicMed privileges?</li><li>If you would like to take the course without the intention of exercising BasicMed privileges, you may close your browser window after completing the quiz.
